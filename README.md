# WHOM

__WHOM__ is a text-based adventure game using `d3-hierarchy` and `react`. Each decision you make will take you down a different path with different outcomes.

This is still very much a work-in-progress.

## Getting Started

#### Step 1 - Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. If the below command does not return anything in your console, visit the link above to download Node.js.

    node --version

We reccomend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage multiple versions of node on the same machine. You will find a `.nvmrc` specifying the major version of node __WHOM__ is currently being developed with.

### Step 2 - Installation

Clone the repo using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/joeLepper/whom.git

Then, install node_modules for dependency reference. If you're using npm:

    npm install

And if you're using Yarn:

    yarn install

### Step 3 - Launch the program

You can launch the program using either yarn or npm scripts.

    npm start
    yarn start

## That's it!

You should be up and running now. An Electron browser window should automatically open as part of the start script.
